Getting Started on Mac OS 10.6
------------------------------

### Xcode

#### Download & Install

<http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html>


### Git

#### Download & Install from Source on Mac OS 10.6

Run the following terminal commands:

    # **C**hange **D**irectory to where you want to store Git's source files
    cd ~/Sources/ # where I store source code that I don't work on

Reference: <http://www.mattdipasquale.com/blog/2010/05/30/instructions-how-to-install-git-from-source-on-mac-os-x-10-6-snow-leopard-intel-x86-32-bit>

#### Clone Repositories

Run the following terminal commands:

    # **C**hange **D**irectory to where you want to store acani's source files
    cd ~/Projects/ # where I store projects that I work on

    # Clone the repository to your machine
    git clone git@github.com:acani/acani.git

    # Initialize & update the submodules according to .gitmodules
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

#### Required Reading

* Submodules: <http://book.git-scm.com/5_submodules.html>
* Workflow: [link to git workflow]
* Great Book: <http://book.git-scm.com/>

*CHECKPOINT*: You can now `open acani-iphone/Lovers/Lovers.xcodeproj` in Xcode
and build & run it with profile functionality (as long as you're connected to
the Internet). We're now hosting the profile info, and pictures & thumbnails on
Heroku, using Sinatra & MongoHQ. For example, go here
http://acani.heroku.com/users/4c96ee4f1467281352000049/26312E44-7A20-5E47-8347-15C8B5B55A21/40.748470/-73.999815
to see a list of the 20 closest users to the coordinates at the end of the URI.

You can edit some fields of a user profile here:
http://acani.heroku.com/4c96fa4714672817ae000073/edit
where 4c96fa4714672817ae000073 is the uid

To unlock chat functionality, skip to "Node.js & Redis chat server" to install
them locally. Everything in between is just to get Sinatra & MongoDB running
locally, which you don't really need anymore now that it's running on Heroku.


### Install Ruby & Gems with RVM

RVM: <http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/basics/>

#### RVM
    bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )

#### Ruby 1.9.1
    rvm install 1.9.1; rvm 1.9.1
    ruby -v; which ruby # check if it's working

#### Gems
    rvm gemset create acani # create a gemset for acani
    rvm --default ruby-1.9.1@acani # set your default ruby & gemset

    # Quit & Relaunch Terminal
    rvm list default; rvm gemset name # check what your default ruby is

    gem install bundler
    bundle install # installs the gems for this rails app, listed in Gemfile
    bundle lock

#### Heroku
    gem install heroku


### MongoDB

#### Install

<http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart>

    # If installing or upgrading with homebrew, automatically load on login with:
    launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.mongodb.mongod.plist
    cp /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/1.4.3-x86_64/org.mongodb.mongod.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.mongodb.mongod.plist

#### Seed

1. Start MongoDB with the command `mongod` if not yet running.

2. Run `ruby acani-sinatra/seed/profiles.rb` to populate the MongoDB database.

3. In `Constatns.h` in `acani-iphone/Lovers/Lovers.xcodeproj`, redefine
   `SINATRA` to the local URI in the comment.

*CHECKPOINT*: When you build the iPhone app now, it will use the profile info,
and pictures & thumbnails from your local machine. Congrats! You're a true
developer now.


### Node.js & Redis chat server

Follow the README files below to install Node.js & Redis:

* http://github.com/ry/node
* http://github.com/antirez/redis

    # Open Terminal to start the Node.js server:
    cd acani-node
    node acani-node-server.js

    # Open a 2nd Terminal tab/window to start the Redis server:
    /path/to/redis/src/redis-server redis.conf

    # (Optional) Open a 3rd Terminal tab/window to start a Redis client.
    /path/to/redis/src/redis-cli # allows you to query the Redis server
    # For example:
    smembers online # show members in set 'online'
    srem online bob # remove 'bob' from set 'online'

    open index.html # in a browser that supports WebSockets & has a JS Console

*CHECKPOINT*: Now, you should be able to send & receive messages and log in &
out.


Public API
----------

Right now, we have an internal API that the iPhone code uses. Eventually, we'll
have a public API for developers of other software to access the acani servers.
The public API will work like the Facebook Graph API:
<http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api>
